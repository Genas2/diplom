                IMPROVED LEVENBERG-MARQUARDT METHOD FOR
                 NON-LINEAR LEAST SQUARES OPTIMIZATION

DESCRIPTION:
This function is used to find minimum of function which is represented  as
sum of squares:
    F(x) = f[0]^2(x[0],...,x[n-1]) + ... + f[m-1]^2(x[0],...,x[n-1])
using value of function vector f[] and Jacobian of f[].


REQUIREMENTS:
This algorithm will request following information during its operation:

* function vector f[] at given point X
* function vector f[] and Jacobian of f[] (simultaneously) at given point

There are several overloaded versions of  MinLMOptimize()  function  which
correspond  to  different LM-like optimization algorithms provided by this
unit. You should choose version which accepts fvec()  and jac() callbacks.
First  one  is used to calculate f[] at given point, second one calculates
f[] and Jacobian df[i]/dx[j].

You can try to initialize MinLMState structure with VJ  function and  then
use incorrect version  of  MinLMOptimize()  (for  example,  version  which
works  with  general  form function and does not provide Jacobian), but it
will  lead  to  exception  being  thrown  after first attempt to calculate
Jacobian.


USAGE:
1. User initializes algorithm state with MinLMCreateVJ() call
2. User tunes solver parameters with MinLMSetCond(),  MinLMSetStpMax() and
   other functions
3. User calls MinLMOptimize() function which  takes algorithm  state   and
   callback functions.
4. User calls MinLMResults() to get solution
5. Optionally, user may call MinLMRestartFrom() to solve  another  problem
   with same N/M but another starting point and/or another function.
   MinLMRestartFrom() allows to reuse already initialized structure.


INPUT PARAMETERS:
    N       -   dimension, N>1
                * if given, only leading N elements of X are used
                * if not given, automatically determined from size of X
    M       -   number of functions f[i]
    X       -   initial solution, array[0..N-1]

OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
    State   -   structure which stores algorithm state

NOTES:
1. you may tune stopping conditions with MinLMSetCond() function
2. if target function contains exp() or other fast growing functions,  and
   optimization algorithm makes too large steps which leads  to  overflow,
   use MinLMSetStpMax() function to bound algorithm's steps.

This function is used to change acceleration settings

You can choose between three acceleration strategies:
* AccType=0, no acceleration.
* AccType=1, secant updates are used to update quadratic model after  each
  iteration. After fixed number of iterations (or after  model  breakdown)
  we  recalculate  quadratic  model  using  analytic  Jacobian  or  finite
  differences. Number of secant-based iterations depends  on  optimization
  settings: about 3 iterations - when we have analytic Jacobian, up to 2*N
  iterations - when we use finite differences to calculate Jacobian.
* AccType=2, after quadratic model is built and LM step is made, we use it
  as preconditioner for several (5-10) iterations of L-BFGS algorithm.

AccType=1 is recommended when Jacobian  calculation  cost  is  prohibitive
high (several Mx1 function vector calculations  followed  by  several  NxN
Cholesky factorizations are faster than calculation of one M*N  Jacobian).
It should also be used when we have no Jacobian, because finite difference
approximation takes too much time to compute.

AccType=2 is recommended when Jacobian is cheap - much more  cheaper  than
one  Cholesky  factorization.   We   can   reduce   number   of   Cholesky
factorizations at the cost of increased number of  Jacobian  calculations.
Sometimes it helps.

1. Depending on function used to create state  structure,  this  algorithm
   may accept Jacobian and/or Hessian and/or gradient.  According  to  the
   said above, there ase several versions of this function,  which  accept
   different sets of callbacks.

   This flexibility opens way to subtle errors - you may create state with
   MinLMCreateFGH() (optimization using Hessian), but call function  which
   does not accept Hessian. So when algorithm will request Hessian,  there
   will be no callback to call. In this case exception will be thrown.

   Be careful to avoid such errors because there is no way to find them at
   compile time - you can see them at runtime only.

Buffered implementation of MinLMResults(), which uses pre-allocated buffer
to store X[]. If buffer size is  too  small,  it  resizes  buffer.  It  is
intended to be used in the inner cycles of performance critical algorithms
where array reallocation penalty is too large to be ignored.
