Estimate of a matrix condition number (1-norm)

The algorithm calculates a lower bound of the condition number. In this case,
the algorithm does not return a lower bound of the condition number, but an
inverse number (to avoid an overflow in case of a singular matrix).

Input parameters:
    A   -   matrix. Array whose indexes range within [0..N-1, 0..N-1].
    N   -   size of matrix A.

Result: 1/LowerBound(cond(A))

NOTE:
    if k(A) is very large, then matrix is  assumed  degenerate,  k(A)=INF,
    0.0 is returned in such cases.
